# UsefulBashScripts
This is a collection of small but handy bash scripts that I've wrote over the past years.
Each script is not very challenging nor difficult to implement. However, they safe time, improve workflow
and I don't have to remember every bash syntax.

# Installation
Clone the repository and execute the script with ./[ScriptName]. You may make the scripts globally excecutable
but creating a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin/ . You may also use CreateNewCommand.sh for this task
